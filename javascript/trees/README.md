# Binary Trees
- Create a class BTNode that has properties for this.value, this.left, this.right
- Create a class Binary Tree and define these methods: preOrder, inOrder, postOrder, findMax.
- findMax: arguments: none, returns: number.
- Create a class Binary Search Tree and define these methods: add and contains.
- add: arguments: value, returns: nothing.
- contains: arguments: value, returns boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.

## Approach & Efficiency
I worked a lot with recursion in order to handle these methods. It was helpful to incorporate a helper function in the methods in order to do the recursion.
